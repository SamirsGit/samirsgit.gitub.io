### CyberDefenders: T1110-003 Lab  

- **Splunk** can be seen as a giant search engine for all of your data that your computers produce. This will include error messages, login attempts, and network traffic. Companies use this tool to gather a plethora of information in one place to efficiently spot problems or suspicious behaviors. Splunk will collect and store messages in one central spot, organize and label the data, and enable the user to query information to effectively mitigate and remediate threats resulting in an enhanced overall security posture. 

- **Cyberdefenders** is a training platform for security professionals to learn, validate, and advance their cyber defense capabilities through self-driven hands-on training to prepare for real world challenges, particularly in blue team operations. Cyberdefenders uses real world situations and regularly updates to reflect latest trends and techniques in cybersecurity. This ensures that the training remains relevant and aligned with ongoing developments within the industry. 

- **Scenario: T1110-003 - Password Spraying**: attackers often try a small list of passwords across multiple accounts. Because they only test one or few passwords per account, they avoid lockouts typical of traditional brute force attempts on a single account. Password spraying often hits standard management services including: SSH (22), Telent (23), FTP (21), SMB (139,445), LDAP (389), Kerberos (88), RDP (3389), HTTP/HTTPS (80,443), MSSQL (1433), Oracle (1521), MySQL (3306), and VNC (5900). This lab is focused on Splunk, Event Viewer would be an alternative tool that can be used to investigate this incident.  

**Q1** Who was the last logged in user?

![Splunk](:003_splunk2.png){:data-align="center"}

![Splunk](:003_splunk1.png){:data-align="center"}

**Q2** What is the logon type of the failed logons?

![Splunk](:003_splunk3.png){:data-align="center"}

**Q3** What is the protocol that attacker tried to bruteforce?

**Q4** How many users did the attacker succeed in getting their accounts?

**Q5** According to Microsoft, what is the description of the 'Sub Status' code for event ID 4625?

**Q6** How long did the bruteforce last?

**Q7** How long did the attacker login to the machine again? 

**Q8** What is the name of the policy used to lock the account after a certain number of failed login attempts?
