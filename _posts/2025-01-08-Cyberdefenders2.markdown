### Neris Botnet 

**Botnet** is a network of compromised computers that communicate with a central C&C server with the HTTP protocol.  

**Q1** Unusual patterns of activity were observed in Suricata logs. One external IP initiated access and was fond downloading a suspicious executable file. What is the IP address from which this unauthorized access originated? 

- **Eventtype** field groups similar events together based on specific search patterns. This will allow you to search for specific types of events with a low chance of altering the raw data, which is a risk when using complex search queries each time. In this lab, the eventtype suricata_eve_ids_attack seems to a good option.

- **Statistics** this tab is used to perform quantitative analysis on data to help summarize and analyze large datasets in values such as averages, sums, counts, and more. There are multiple fields, in your query pick the ones that are most applicable.
