### OverTheWire: Introduction 

Starting from level 0, each level introduces new challenges, guiding players on how to advance their skillset step by step throughout the game. My tech notes will provide practical solutions, tips, and explanations in order to help others underatand the command line, troubleshoot issues, and improve problem solving skills. Referencing material while learning is never a bad idea, it will help reinforce and recitate on important fundamentals that will be useful in the future. Navigating computers using the command line is essential in tech fields such as cybersecurity, programming, and system administration. 

- Efficiency: faster than using the GUI, scripts can be used to save significant time.
- Control: greater access and additional ways to manipulate files, system processes, and configurations.
- Resources: CLI is more lightweight than GUI, uses less sytem resources, and is essential for automation tasks.

SSH Information:  Host = bandit.labs.overthewire.org    Port = 2220 

### Level: 0 

This level requires the user to connect to a remote server using SSH over port 2220. Given to use, we have the username bandit0 and password bandit0. The command I used to proceed:  ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

#### Commands Used: 
- **ssh** (Secure Shell) - Used to securely connect to the Bandit server, usual port is 22. Insecure version is Telnet (23).
- **ls** (List) - Useed to list files and directories in the current directory. Useful for finding available files & data. 
- **cat** (Concatenate) - Used to display the contents of a file, in this case revealing the password for the next level.

Note: it is best practice to operate as a regular user for tasks like connecting to a remote server. Only elevate with sudo when needed for specific administrative tasks.

### Level: 1
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

**Notes**:
- In future levels, you may encounter files with names starting with a dash. This can cause issues, as commands often interpret the dash as an option (for example, ls -a)
- **Options** - also known as a flag or switch, is a way to modify a command to alter its output.

### Level: 2
The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory

**Notes**:
- The file name contains spaces, you must enclose the file name in either single or double quotes to ensure the command interprets it as a single item rather than seperate arguments.
- **Tab key** enables auto completion when typing commands, file names, or directory paths. This way you can finish typing quickly & accurately.

### Level: 3
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

**Commands**:
- cd (change directory) this command is used to navigate between directories by moving to different locations within the file system.
- ls -a (list all) - this tells ls to list all files, including hidden files (such as those starting with a dot '.') 

##### Solution:

Level Password: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ

### Level: 4
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. 

**Commands**:
- **file** - tells the system to examine the specififed file, in this case all files in this directory * and attempt to classify them by types.
- * the astericks is a wildcare that matches all files in this directory. By combining this with ./ (current directory) we find all files in the current directory ./*
- ASCII - in this example, this is the only human readable file in the inhere directory.
