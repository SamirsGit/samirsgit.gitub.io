### OverTheWire: Bandit 0 - Introduction 

[https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) 

Starting from level 0, each level introduces new challenges, guiding players on how to advance their skillset step by step throughout the game. My tech notes will provide practical solutions, tips, and explanations in order to help others underatand the command line, troubleshoot issues, and improve problem solving skills. Refernecing material while learning is never a bad idea, it will help reinforce and recitate on important fundamentals that will be useful in the future.

#### Level: 0 

This level requires the user to connect to a remote server using SSH over port 2220. Given to use, we have the username bandit0 and password bandit0. The command I used to proceed:  ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

#### Commands Used: 
ssh (Secure Shell) - Used to securely connect to the Bandit server, usual port is 22. Insecure version is Telnet (23).
ls (List) - Useed to list files and directories in the current directory. Useful for finding available files & data. 
cat (Concatenate) - Used to display the contents of a file, in this case revealing the password for the next level.

Note: it is best practice to operate as a regular user for tasks like connecting to a remote server. Only elevate with sudo when needed for specific administrative tasks.
