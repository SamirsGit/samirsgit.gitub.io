### OverTheWire: 
##### The next levels will test skills in file manipulation, data extraction, and various encoding schemes.

### Level: 13 
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

**Commands Used:** 
- **ssh** - (Secure Shell: Default - Port 22) used to securely connect to a remote machine, provides encrypted commmunication between 2 untrusted hosts over an insecure network.   
- **sshkey.private** (Private SSH key) this is used for authenticating your identity when connecting to a remote server using SSH.

Exposing private keys in public repositories or shared systems is a security issue, keep private keys secure.

Once you obtain access, you will be able to find the password in the stored location:  cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 

Level Password: MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS

### Level: 14 
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

**Commands Used:** 
**nc** (netcat) - network communication tool that allows users to read and write data across network connections using TCP or UDP.
- netcat can be used for port scanning, file transferring, network debugging, connecting systems together, and tunneling.
- netcat can listen for incoming connections, which can receive commmands on a backdoored device.
- netcat can monitor network traffic, detect anomalous activity, and transfer files to another system.

In this level, we established a connection to a service running on the local machine on port 30000.
